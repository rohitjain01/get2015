Author			: Rohit

----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Write a user registration application:
   Contains a user registration information form (JSP page) that requests a servlet.
   Contains a servlet that accepts the request sent by client and persists the information in the database tables.


2. Write a login page:
   Contains a login jsp page which requires username and password.
   The login page requests a servlet to validate the login credentials.
   The servlet calls the api to fetch the information saved in assignment #1 
   and then validates it (possibly username and password) against the login credentials.
   In case of successful login the jsp page must be displayed showing the successfully logged in 
   and in case of failure the login page must again be displayed to re-login.
