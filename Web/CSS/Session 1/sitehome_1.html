					<p>Yoga has been gaining immense popularity due to the short-term as well as long-term benefits that it provides.
					The aims of the yoga enthusiasts are extremely varied. Some are particularly inspired by the Spiritual Element 
					that yoga provides; others by the increased Fitness and Flexibility that it results in. Some people find 
					solutions to suffering from varied Health Disorders and there are others who achieve an All-Round Development
					of a calm, stress-free mind and a fit body. We bring to you a collection of yoga articles that are specifically 
					chosen keeping these objectives in mind, while being presented in an easy to understand manner. Hope you enjoy reading them.</p>
					<p>The benefits of yoga provide both instant gratification and lasting transformation. In the fitness world, both 
					are extremely important. Too much time with too few results can be incredibly discouraging, and monotonous routines
					week after week can lead to stagnation. Yoga can change your physical and mental capacity quickly, while preparing
					the mind and body for long-term health.</p>
