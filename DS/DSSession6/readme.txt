----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create a custom class say Employee with fields as empId, name and address. Create a collection of this employee class.
   a) Perform sorting on this collection i.e natural order.(Employee.java)
   b) Perform sorting on this collection based on the employee Name.(Employee2.java)
   c) Create a collection for these employees to avoid any duplicate employee entry.(EmployeeSet.java)

2. Write a method that takes a string and returns the number of unique characters in the string.
   It is expected that a string with the same character sequence may be passed several times to the method.
   Since the counting operation can be time consuming, the methods should cache the results,
   so that when the methods is given a string previously encountered, it will simply retrieve the stored result.
   Use collection and maps where appropriate. (UniqueCharacter.java)
